# Wemsc

Wemsc is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project styled using TailwindCSS. 

## Getting Started

Clone the project using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/byt3h3ad/wemsc.git
```

Enter the folder and install dependencies:

```
cd wemsc
pnpm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

We make use of ESLint to check for linting errors and Prettier to enforce a style guide. Make sure to run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm pretty` to check for errors before commiting. `lint-staged` will be setup in later versions.
